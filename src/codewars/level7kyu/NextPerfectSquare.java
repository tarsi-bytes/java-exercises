/*
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
---
Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square
after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is
an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
---
If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty
value like None or null, depending on your language. You may assume the argument
is non-negative.

/*
A perfect square is a number that results from an integer being multiplied by itself.
For example, 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 x 3. To determine if a number is a
perfect square, you can calculate its square root. If the square root is a whole number,
then the original number is a perfect square.

The method Math.sqrt() in Java is used to compute the square root of a number.
It always returns a double, even if the result is a whole number.
For example:
    Math.sqrt(16) -> 4.0
    Math.sqrt(20) -> 4.472135...
